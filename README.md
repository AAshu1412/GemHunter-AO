# Introduction

Welcome to **GemHunter-AO**, a thrilling grid-based gambling game where strategy, luck, and timing determine your rewards. In this game, players can choose a grid filled with hidden mines, each holding the potential for significant wins or losses. Your goal is to uncover diamonds and increase your earnings by selecting tiles on a 5x5 grid without hitting a bomb.

The more bombs you choose, the higher the potential reward, and for every diamond you uncover, your earnings increase by `0.002` times.

If you're able to successfully avoid the bombs and uncover all the diamonds, your winnings are further amplified by a `5x` multiplier, rewarding your skill and strategy. Players can stop the game at any point to cash out, and their game data is securely stored in a **Lua lsqlite3** database, ensuring that they can continue from where they left off, even if they leave mid-game.
